A template for building Flask applications.

Usage
=====

Installation
------------

TODO

Requirements
------------

TODO

* flask
* flask-login
* flask-wtf
* flask-sqlalchemy
* sqlalchemy
* ldap3

Configuration
-------------

You'll need to create a `config.py` file, which specifies details such as which LDAP
server to use. A sample configuration file can be found at `sample_config.py`.

Starting the Server
-------------------

Start the server with `run.py`. By default it will be accessible at `localhost:9999`. To
make the server world-accessible or for other options, see `run.py -h`.

If you're having trouble configuring your sever, I wrote a
[blog post](http://blog.spurll.com/2015/02/configuring-flask-uwsgi-and-nginx.html)
explaining how you can get Flask, uWSGI, and Nginx working together.
